Hey there, I am Alex and this is my personal webpage ðŸ¦Š



I am PhD student at <a href="https://ist.ac.at/en/home/">IST Austria</a>. I am extremely lucky to be co-advised by <a href="http://marcomondelli.com/">Marco Mondelli</a>
and <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/alistarh/">Dan Alistarh</a>. I am broadly interested in *theoretical foundations of machine learning* leaning towards

- analysis of training dynamics of over-parameterized models
- non-convex optimization in high dimensions in general

Before joining IST Austria, I got my bachelor's degree at <a href="https://cs.hse.ru/en/">CS HSE</a> and was a master student in Statistical Learning Theory at a joint programme at HSE and <a href="https://www.skoltech.ru/en/">Skoltech</a>. During my undergrad and master's I was part of <a href="https://bayesgroup.ru/">Bayesian Methods research group</a> supervised by <a href="https://aosokin.github.io/">Anton Osokin</a> and <a href="https://www.hse.ru/en/staff/dvetrov">Dmitry Vetrov</a>. I was also a research assistant at Samsung-HSE laboratory affiliated with the group.

Outside my research activities, I enjoy (ðŸ˜… sometimes unhealthy amount of) anime and manga, hitting the gym and failing my bulking plans, waiting for the next Hidetaka Miyazaki's masterpiece, and making sure that my music library and guitar do not collect too much dust.
