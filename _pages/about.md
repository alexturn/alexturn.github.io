Hey there, I am Alex and this is my personal webpage ðŸ¦Š

<<<<<<< HEAD
Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am PhD student at <a href="https://ist.ac.at/en/home/">IST Austria</a>. I am extremely lucky to be co-adviced by <a href="http://marcomondelli.com/">Marco Mondelli</a>
and <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/alistarh/">Dan Alistarh</a>. I am broadly interested in *theoretical foundations of machine learning* leaning towards

- analysis of training dynamics of over-parameterized models
- non-convex optimization in high dimensions in general

Before joining IST Austria, I got my bachelor's degree at <a href="https://cs.hse.ru/en/">CS HSE</a> and was a master student in Statistical Learning Theory at a joint programme at HSE and <a href="https://www.skoltech.ru/en/">Skoltech</a>. During my undergrad and master's I was part of <a href="https://bayesgroup.ru/">Bayesian Methods research group</a> and reasearch assistant at Samsung-HSE laboratory supervised by <a href="https://aosokin.github.io/">Anton Osokin</a> and <a href="https://www.hse.ru/en/staff/dvetrov">Dmitry Vetrov</a>.

Outside my research activities, I enjoy (ðŸ˜… sometimes unhealthy amount of) anime and manga, hitting the gym and failing my bulking plans, waiting for the next Hidetaka Miyazaki's masterpiece, and making sure that my music library and guitar do not collect too much dust.
